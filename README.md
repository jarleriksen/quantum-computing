# Quantum Mechanics

## Double-slit experiment
- Is a demonstration that light and matter can characteristics of both classically defined waves and particle. It displays the fundamentally probabilistic nature of quantum mechanical phenomena.
- The experiment is performed as demonstrated below: using a source of light, could be a laser beam, is passing through the slits. The light is then observed on the plate behind the slits.

- If one of the slits is closed the light passing through will generate the wave shown on figure A.
- However, if both slits are open, you would assume that it the wave would be the sum of both waves and generate the wave shown on figure B.

- That is not the case, it will generate what is known as an interference pattern:

Figure C is also known as a Wave Function in Quantum Mechanics.

## Interference
Happens when one or more waves/particles are sent from the same source, or when they have the same or almost the same frequency.
Interference effects can be observed with all types of waves for example light, radio, acoustic, surface water waves, gravity waves, or matter waves.


### Constructive Interference

In the figure above we can see two waves with the same frequency traveling in the same direction. 
If we add the two waves together point for point they will generate a wave that looks almost identical to the first, but its amplitude is larger.

When the resulting wave is larger than the original waves its called constructive interference.
### Destructive Interference

Again, we have two waves with the same frequency traveling in the same direction.
If we try to add these two together when the first wave is up and the second is down, the two add to zero. When the first wave is down and the second is up, they again add to zero. This means that all points of the waves cancels out each other out. The sum of the waves can either be lower than either wave, alone or even zero. This is called destructive interference.
