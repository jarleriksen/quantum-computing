# Qubits and Quantum States

## The Qubit
Basic unit of information processing in a modern computer is the bit, which can assume two states that we label 0 and 1.
We can also define a basic unit of information processing that can be used in quantum computation. Although a qubit and a bit might seem similar, they are fundamentally different.
We label the states for a qubit by $|0\rangle$     and      $|1\rangle$. In Quantum Theory an object enclosed by the notation  | $\rangle$ can be called a state, a vector or a ket.

A qubit can exist in the state  $|0\rangle$     or      $|1\rangle$, but it can also exist in a state called **superposition**. We can label this state as $|\psi\rangle$ a superposition state would be written as:

$$ 
|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle
$$

$\alpha$  and  $\beta$  are complex numbers.
